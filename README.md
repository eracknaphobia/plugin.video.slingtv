## Initial Setup
* Install [IPTV Manager from their github repo](https://github.com/add-ons/service.iptv.manager/releases) as the version in the official kodi repo doesn't work correctly.
  - Make sure to disable updates for iptv manager or it will install the kodi repo version over top since it is a version ahead currently
* Open the Sling TV addon it will prompt you to login to your account or select Stream Free
* Once you've logged in successfully go to IPTV Manager Settings and select **Refresh channels and guide now**
* It's recommended that you set the **Refresh interval** in IPTV Manager to 12 hours (or lower) since guide data is 24 hr period this will prevent any gaps in the guide
